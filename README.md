# fruits-game
A self learning project based on javascript  arrays concept developed by using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

Main features
1. There will be a basket of fruits on clicking particular buttons we can count fruits, sort fruits and delete fruits.
2. A separate baskets will be available to separate fruits by clicking particular  button we can separate them.
3. If we delete the fruits in the basket the count will show 0 and we cannot sort fruits.
4. We cannot seprate fruits after deleting from the basket.

Its just a simple project for self learning and advancing my skills to build advanced projects.
If you have any suggestions or contributions can be appreciated.
